                question 1:
                Differences between var, let, and const

                var let const
                The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope
                of a const variable is block scope.
                It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the
                scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
                It can be declared without initialization. It can be declared without initialization. It cannot be
                declared without initialization.
                It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”. It cannot be accessed
                without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’. It cannot be accessed without
                initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.

                question 2:The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions

                Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of
                the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the
                arguments passed to arrow functions.The arrow function example above allows a developer to accomplish
                the same result with fewer lines of code and approximately half the typing.
